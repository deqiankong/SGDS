# Sampling with Gradual Distribution Shifting (SGDS)
This is the repository for our paper "Molecule Design by Latent Space Energy-based Modeling and Gradual Distribution Shifting" in UAI 2023.

![alt text](https://github.com/deqiankong/SGDS/blob/main/model.png)

In this paper, we studied the following property optimization tasks:
* single-objective p-logP maximization
* single-objective QED maximization
* single-objective ESR1 maximization
* single-objective ACAA1 maximization
* multi-objective (ESR1, QED, SA) optmization
* multi-objective (ACAA1, QED, SA) optmization
